This is my modification of the original game "BOFH: Servers Under Siege".
I just changed the keys (ctrl=shoot) and other minor things.
I advise to play the game in 'insane' because it's challenging.

I dont know if the original game license is GPL-compatible, I think it is.
More information in bofh.txt.
